== Constrained annotations ==

=== Meta-annotation `@Target` ===

Using `@Target` meta-annotation you can easily annotate annotations (yes, it's kind of scary!) to prevent annotations to be misplaced.

For example you might want a `@Route` annotation that can be only used to annotate methods.  It's easy:

{{{
/** @Target("method") */
class Route extends Annotation {}
}}}


=== Implementing custom constraints ===

Sometimes `@Target` meta-annotation does not provide enough power to check for additional constraints. You can override Annotation::checkConstraints method to add additional rules for validation, etc.

{{{
class Route extends Annotation {
   protected function checkConstraints($target) {
      if($this->value == /* something bad */) {
         // trigger some error
      } else {
         // do something else
      }
      // variable $target holds reflection class of annotation target (class, method, property)
   }
}
}}}
